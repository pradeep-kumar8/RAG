# üîç GenAI-LLM

### (Hugging Face, LangChain, Gemini, ChatGPT, FAISS, RAG)

Welcome to **GenAI-LLM**!  
This repository is a collection of powerful and modular AI applications built using state-of-the-art **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques. Projects here leverage models and APIs like **Mistral 7B**, **Google Gemini 1.5**, **Meta LLaMA**, and others for solving real-world problems ‚Äî from document QA to intelligent chatbots.

### 1. **PDF Chatbot with Multi-LLM Support**
A powerful chatbot that allows you to **upload a PDF and ask questions** directly about its contents using the power of **LangChain + FAISS + Hugging Face** hosted models.

**Features:**
- Upload and parse PDFs.
- Choose from multiple Hugging Face-hosted LLMs (Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, LLaMA 3, Bloom).
- Embeds and retrieves data using FAISS.
- Semantic search + contextual answers using RetrievalQA chain.
